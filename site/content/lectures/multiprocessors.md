# Why

![](/uploads/snipaste_2021-04-11_18-48-37.png)

Increasing CPU frequency helps to increase performance

### Power Consumption

Power = Capacitive Load * VoltageÂ² * Frequency

Reducing load, voltage and frequency can decrease power consumption

CPU frequency has hit a "frequency wall" / "power wall" - hard to get faster. Instead of increasing the speed of a core, just add more cores!

# Multiprocessors

All processors perform in parallel, achieving high performance.  
Power consumption scales linearly.

## Processor Classes

* SISD - Single instruction, single data
* SIMD - Single instruction, multiple data
* MISD - Multiple instruction, single data
* MIMD - Multiple instruction, multiple data

# UMA (Uniform Memory Access)

![](/uploads/snipaste_2021-04-11_19-51-16.png)

All processors share a **single bus** to access memory and I/O resources.  
Allows for simple data sharing, but restricts performance (exclusive access).  
All memory locations have similar latencies - hence the **uniform** access.  
Each processor also has a local cache (which will be invalidated when memory updates???)

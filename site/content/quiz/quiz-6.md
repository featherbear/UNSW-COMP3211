> Which of the following statement is/are not true?

a. For the direct-mapped cache, the random replacement policy is usually better than the least recently used policy.  
b. There is no way to reduce compulsory misses.  
c. Fully associative cache has no conflict misses.  
d. The cache performance is measured by cache miss rate.

> The figure below shows a processor system. The write buffer can hold the data of four writes. Assume the data memory access time is 20 clock cycles.   
> How frequently can the processor write data to memory without the write buffer saturation?

a. On average, one write every 20 clock cycles.  
b. On average, one write per 4 clock cycles.  
c. On average, one write per 5 clock cycles.  
d. None of the above
